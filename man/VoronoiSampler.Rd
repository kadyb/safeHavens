\title{Make a voronoi sample of an area n times}
\usage{
VoronoiSampler(polygon, n, collections, reps)

VoronoiSampler(polygon, n, collections, reps)
}
\arguments{
\item{polygon}{The input sf polygon, i.e. species range or administrative unit, where sampling is desired.}

\item{n}{Numeric. The total number of desired collections. Defaults to 20.}

\item{collections}{an sf point geometry data set of where existing collections have been made.}

\item{reps}{Numeric. The number of times to rerun the voronoi algorithm, the set of polygons with the most similar sizes, as
measured using their variance of areas will be selected. Defaults to 150, which may accomplish around 100 succesful iterations.}
}
\description{
Split an area up into n polygons of roughly equal area, optionally removing
some of the default points and replacing them with existing collections to
build the future collections around.
