#' Modify the output rasters from the SDM process to better match target goals
#' 
#' @description This is the last 'analytical' portion of the SD modelling process. It will
#' produce binary (Yes/ NA) rasters of species suitable habitat based on a three step
#' process. The first step uses dismo::thresholds to determine what feature of the
#' raster we want to maximuize, in this case I want a raster to be *more* than less
#' likely to capture a presence than omit it. Then we can subset the predicted habitat, which
#' has not been dispersed too by comparing nearest neighbor distances of the observed points. 
#' Finally, we can add back in areas to the raster where we know that the species has been 
#' observed, hopefully these are not missed in the original SDM, but there are always
#' some suspicious points which are difficult to fit in light of the inertia 
#' of the rest of the species. 
#' @param rast_cont the raw unaltered (except masked) raster predictions (x$RasterPredictions). 
#' @param test the test data partition from the `elasticSDM` function (x$TestData).
#' @param train the train data partition from the `elasticSDM` function (x$TrainData).
#' @param thresh_metric ?dismo::threshold for all options, defaults to 'sensitivity'
#' @param quan_amt the quantile of nearest neighbors distance to use for steps 2 and 3. 
#' defaults to 0.25, using the median nearest neighbor distance of 10 bootstrapping replicates for
#' estimating a buffer to restrict the SDM surface too, and the minimum of the 10 bootstrap reps
#' for adding surface to presence points which were not placed in binary suitable habitat.
#' @param planar_proj Numeric, or character vector. An EPSG code, or a proj4 string, for a planar coordinate projection, in meters, for use with the function. For species with very narrow ranges a UTM zone may be best (e.g. 32611 for WGS84 zone 11 north, or 29611 for NAD83 zone 11 north). Otherwise a continental scale projection like 5070 See https://projectionwizard.org/ for more information on CRS. The value is simply passed to sf::st_transform if you need to experiment.  
#' @return A list containing two options. 1) A spatraster with 4 layers, A) the continuous probabilities of suitable habitat feed in from `elasticSDM`, B) this raster in binary format based on the specified thresholding statistic, C) the binary raster from B + with habitat clipped to the buffer distances determined by measuring nearest neighbor distances and thresholding at a quantile D) the binary raster from C, adding the same distance to points which were initially in cells classified by thresholding as not having suitable habitat.
#' D' is the general basis for all future steps, but either B, or C serve as alternatives. 
#' 2) All threshold statistics calculated by dismo as a dataframe.
